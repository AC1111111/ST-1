    <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>

    <p>
        I'm currently a 3rd year student of Computer Science and Engineering at Chitkara University, Punjab. Passionate
        about Technical
        artistry (video games to be precise) and just love tinkering with different creation tools and frameworks.
    </p>

    <h3>Endless Runner Game</h3>
    <img src="Course Full.png" alt="A Picture from the project" class="Image">
    <p>
        I made an Endless Runner game in Unreal Engine 4 for a school project. The game used a combination of C++
        and Unreal's Blueprint
        Visual Scripting system.
    </p>

    <h3>Remotely Controlled Polysynth</h3>
    <img src="PolySynth.png" alt="A Picture from the project" class="Image">
    <p>
        I also made a polysynth that ran on a Raspberry Pi and could be controlled via an Android app using a USB cable.
        The polysynth was
        created in SonicPi using Ruby and used the Android device as a MIDI keyboard. Although, the app was far from
        finished, it provided
        a solid demonstration of the things that can be done witht this idea.
    </p>

    <h3>An Automatic Mood Light</h3>
    <img src="Moodlight.png" alt="A Picture from the project" class="Image">
    <p>
        I also created a Mood Light that ran on an Arduino Uno using C++. The light would change brightness
        automatically based on the time of day.
    </p>

    <h3>Line following, proximity robot</h3>
    <img src="Robotics.png" alt="A Picture from the project" class="Image">
    <p>
        Me and a team of 2 other people created a Robot for a university project that would follow and object along a
        line. This was done
        using an Arduino Uno, an Ultrasonic Sensor, 2 IR sensors and other miscellaneous components. The project was
        coded by me in C++.
    </p>

    <h3>Video Editing</h3>
    <img src="YT.png" alt="A Picture of the channel" class="Image">
    <p>
        I also got into video editing using Adobe Premiere Pro and have, over the years, put some of my better videos on
        a
        YouTube channel.
